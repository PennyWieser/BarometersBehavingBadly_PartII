This repository contains all the jupyter notebooks and spreadsheets needed to recreate the calculations in 'Barometers behaving Badly Part II'

The final dataset used for plots is LEPR_Wet_Stitched_April2023_Norm100Anhydrs.xlsx
The filtering criteria can be seen in each notebook.

To get just experiments in ArcPL, apply a filter for columns with '_notinLEPR' in the name.
